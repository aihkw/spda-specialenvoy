<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Project Overview</h2>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
Health is fundamental to human development and economic productivity, yet access to quality healthcare remains a significant challenge across the Southern Philippines. While urban centers have relatively adequate medical facilities, rural and remote areas face critical shortages of hospitals, clinics, medical equipment, and healthcare professionals. High maternal and infant mortality rates, prevalence of communicable and lifestyle diseases, limited health insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket healthcare expenses push millions into poverty while constraining human capital development essential for regional progress.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
The SPDA Medical and Healthcare Development Project addresses these challenges through comprehensive investments in healthcare infrastructure, workforce development, disease prevention programs, and universal health coverage. This initiative focuses on constructing modern hospitals and primary care facilities, training and deploying healthcare professionals, strengthening disease surveillance and response systems, and ensuring that quality healthcare becomes accessible and affordable for all residents. By prioritizing preventive care, maternal and child health, and management of non-communicable diseases, the project aims to improve health outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8 text-lg">
Through partnerships with the Department of Health, medical institutions, insurance providers, pharmaceutical companies, and international health organizations, SPDA facilitates investments that transform healthcare delivery across the region. This project embodies SPDA's commitment to inclusive development by ensuring that quality healthcare becomes a right rather than a privilege, enabling all residents of the Southern Philippines to live healthy, productive lives regardless of economic status or geographic location.
